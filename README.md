# LaBB-CAT Demo Exercises

This repository contains worksheets for self-guided study of the [LaBB-CAT corpus analysis tool](https://labbcat.canterbury.ac.nz/). These worksheets were originally written by Robert Fromont, the developer of LaBB-CAT. They have been adapted by Dan Villarreal to reflect improvements to LaBB-CAT's interface since the worksheets were first written; the PDF comments reflect LaBB-CAT version 21210715.1634.
